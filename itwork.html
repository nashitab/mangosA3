							<p style="color:Red;"><b>MISSION STATEMENT</b><p/>
								<p>The end goal for our teams project is to create a criminal based wacky horror game. When being given the opportunity to have our project funded, it would then have a more polished and realistic output. As off right now we are working off a prototype and still are not aware of the practicality of the game itself, but after more professional roles are to take a look at the design they can better adapt it </p>
							<p style="color:Red;"><b>Position Description and skills needed!</b><p/>
					
							<p style="color:Maroon;"><b>Role 1: Game Designer</b><p/>
							<p>In the process of handing down our project to a more professional team who would further develop the project it would be appropriate to hire a game designer. This a role where one comes up with concepts for actual game by developing a storyline and characters, this role entails in collaborating with roles such as the lead designer and programmers to ensure that their work can be produced into the final product. They tune and balance the game play. Skills that this role would need depends on the project at hand, but basic skills can include UI/UX design knowledge, experience with 3d modelling/lighting/texturing, web development and coding of some sort. debugging tools and Knowledge and experience using design software tools and of course the essential skills of being able to work in a team, passion focused and the willingness to embrace new technologies</p>
							<p style="color:Maroon;"><b>Role 2: Software Developer</b><p/>
							<p>As we are developing a game it is crucial to have a software developer on board in the project who has a good experience with the coding language the game is to be coded in and has a good range of knowledge in other languages. For example, to take our game to the next stage it would be appropriate to hire an expert in Python. Their role would be to manage the main processes of the game and collaborate with other colleagues such as the game designer to produce the front end of the game as envisioned by the writers and designers. The backend of the game would have to be critically thought out by the developer and applied where he would have to convey the technical limitations to the main team.  The main skills we would be looking for are: Expert experience in Python, strong communicative skills, experience coding other gaming products, management skills, able to work in a team </p>
							<p style="color:Maroon;"><b>Role 3: Writers </b><p/>
							<p>As mentioned before, the quality of the game depends heavily on its characters and story. Without a proper writer, the game will most certainly fail if it’s bad in the storytelling point of view. If an example is to be given, YIIK is a game that is a decent role-playing game but has one of the worst stories as criticized by almost every gaming review channel on YouTube, as well as from its steam reviews and meta critic. For this project to be at least some part successful, a good writer can lead how the story will go, and thus, how the game will move and its functions.  It’s a story driven game where the story comes first, and the game comes next.</p>
							<p style="color:Maroon;"><b>Role 4: Video Game Tester</b><p/>
							<p>I think employing a video game tester is important for our game for the next phase because the role ensures that our game runs exactly as we want it to. The role will help us deliver a high-quality game without any bugs or defects. Moreover, we want a qualified and experienced video game tester who is dedicated to their job and will report back to us on the problems they found in the game that are not intended to happen. Also they will be able to give their advice on the current version and the areas that can be improved on for the next version. </p>
