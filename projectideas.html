								<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
							<h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Overview </h3>
						
							<p>The Motel is a puzzle based pixelated 2D side scrolling horror game where the players are required to find hints and keys in order to escape from a haunted motel filled with ghastly ‘guests’ which roam within it. Each ‘guest’ has their own unique ability, and players will have to find ways to escape from them while attempting to solve puzzles.</p>
							
							<h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Motivation </h3>
								
							<p>The Motel – is an idea formulated by a fellow group member, where she had suggested that we should create a horror game. A horror game to us is a fun and quirky idea because of how spooky it is. Having liked the idea and the aspect of designing a game, we were all on board for the project. As we all took a programming course and only know the python language, we wanted to take up the challenge of coding on python by using a foreign program (pygame) to create the game.  Furthermore, some of us have used python to create a game and or coded a simple project with it. An addition to why we have chosen to do a game is that it is also easy to delegate between the four of us and we can split up some of the coding to complete the game. </p>
							
							<h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Description </h3>
						
							<p>The Motel within the gaming industry would not be considered a niche game, as many has done similar games like it. The market for The Motel depends on how well the game conveys its story, since these kinds of game usually depend on its narratives more than its gameplay. The Little Nightmares series is an example of it. The general story we have is that a couple, who was in a car in the middle of nowhere after getting lost, arrived at a mysterious motel which had appeared within the darkness of the night. They went in, only to find no one in the reception. With their car tire punctured mysteriously when they return to it, they had no choice but to stay and find materials to fix the car in the meantime from the motel. That is when the player is caught and thrown into the first floor, forced to find their way back to reunite with their partner.</p>
							
							<h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Tools + Tech</h3>
						
							<p>The puzzles on each floor will be different, ranging from math questions to abstract puzzles. While they interact with items and walk-through floors, the enemy, or the ‘guest’, will be roaming around as well, chasing the player the moment they see them. Players will be given a game over if they are caught. To avoid this, players can either hide behind structures within the floor, distract the guests, or find ways to temporarily ward them off. The temporary goal of the game is to unlock floors. Ultimately, the player is attempting to escape from the motel.</p>
							<p>The enemies we’ve came up with ranges from many different types, most inspired by other horror games of similar kind. We have a guest that only appear within fake paintings, which players would have to detect themselves. The level requires the players to find a way to ward off the guest, and destroy the fake paintings the guest was in. There is also a guest with their body parts separated into five (head and limbs), all within different rooms of the floor. The player is required to find their parts and figure out what part needs to be destroyed through finding hints of the guest’s past, while avoiding the main part, the head, from killing them.</p>
						
							
							<h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Skills, Outcome items </h3>
							
							<p>The Motel will be made using pygame, a program designed to code and create games. The program is known for making 2D based game, and it only requires users to know python, making it a friendly program for beginner coders that wants merely learn about programming rules and practices. What we expect to obtain from making this game is the understanding of python and programming rules. By understanding these, we will be able to understand other languages not limited to python easier, thus, is beneficial to us since python is not in high demand within the market as shown by the burning glass data. Furthermore, It also helps with improving our problem-solving skills, an essential skill for programming anything in general.</p>

<h2>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h2>

<button class="accordion">Aims</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>As mentioned above, we have decided that instead of just a regular horror game, we want it to be to a much more wacky, spooky themed, logic-based game where the players will have to play the role of devil prosecutor, here to retrieve wandering souls at a motel who were convinced that they don’t deserve to be sent to hell. 

 For the prosecutor to ‘arrest’ them, they will have to present evidence for their sins, which can be found around the rooms of the specific floor that ghost is wandering in.  </p>
  
  <p>The primary aim that will be achieved in this project is to create a shell, or a much simpler and smaller prototype of the game that is playable. It will be playable for three to ten minutes, where the players will be able to move around, look for clues, and argue with one of the ghosts.  

The graphics will be simple, but enough to show how the game atmosphere will be.</p>

    
   <h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Milestones</h3>
   <p><u>The milestones, or goals we shall achieve is as listed:</u> </p>
   <p><b>1.</b> Create concept art of the game. Multiple concept art will be needed, but these concept arts will be limited to only focusing on the room we plan to implement. This goal is necessary to ensure that we know how the game will feel to create the interface.</p>
      
      <p>------a. Draw concept art for the protagonist. </p>
       <p>------b. Draw concept art for maps. </p>
        <p>------c. Draw concept art for ghosts. </p>
         <p>------d. Draw how the game will look overall.</p>
         
         <p><b>2. </b> Understand how to use Pygames, and proceed to create the prototype itself. This part is necessary for creating the envisioned prototype.</p>
           <p>------a. Allow the character to be able to run, jump and crouch.</p>
            <p>------b. Allow the characters to interact. </p>
             <p>------c.Create an inventory storage. </p>
              <p>------d. Create multiple branches for different choices. </p>
               <p>------e. Make it possible for characters to express differently (sprite animations and still image expressions).</p>
                <p>------f. Create interfaces. (Menu, inventory, start screen, etc.)</p>
                 <p><b>3. </b> Find someone to test to game out for us. Ensure that the game working and presented as intended.</p>
                  <p>------a. Find someone to test to game out for us. Ensure that the game working and presented as intended.  </p>
                   <p>------b. Find a time to interview and test them with the prototype. </p>

<button class="accordion">Plans and Progress</button>
<div class="panel">
 <h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">What our project will do:</h3>
  <p>Our project aims to create a wacky horror Pygame, featuring the main protagonist who from the devil’s realm, being the lazy subject of Satan, had lost his powers and was sent to a haunted motel where the user is faced with wandering souls that they must retrieve and send them back to hell. Each room of the motel features a character with their corresponding story. The user’s job being trying to convince the game that they do not deserve being sent to the devil realm.</p>
  
 <h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">What we will complete the project:</h3>
  <p>Originally, we had aimed to create the game using Pygames where we would code the shell of the game and implement the small stages inside. Seeing as this was difficult and unachievable for some, we have now switched to paper prototyping via Figma where the team is actively collaborating on a document with the prototype</p>
    <h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Prologue/story of the project :</h3>
    <p>At the very beginning, due to how busy we were with other assignments, as well as some personal life issues of some of our members, we did not know how we were going to proceed with the project. 

To take things into matters, one of our members, Zhi Wei, started on the prototype of the game by themselves, making a simple shell for it. She watched video basics about pygames and wrote the code for it. Basic tiles and some sprites were made as well. This was how it looked like:</p>
<html>
<body>
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="200" height="150">
</body>
</html>
<p> The only possible user input at the time were just movement keys up down and left right with a still sprite. Although it looked little, there were already many things written as it’s written from scratch. Writing it may take little time but understanding how the code works was a different story. Zhi Wei had thought that because she has a lot of free time on her hands that she would be able to finish as least a visually appealing prototype of it. But with the time it takes to understand one piece of code however, she realized that although the time it takes may work out for her; it does not mean that it would work out for other teammates who probably do not have the same amount of free time as she has. She then waited for the meeting to discuss about what they can do with the prototype if it was not possible to be completed in the end.</p>

<p>Through meeting with teammates, it was then decided that a paper prototype would be more efficient in a manner where we would be able to present all components of the game we have devised as opposed to a rushed coded game. Some of the team members who are not so confident in coding felt that this would be more practical, and, in this way, everyone would be able to participate in making the paper prototype as it is a simple task. Time was the biggest limitation as we thought that we are not able to complete the code in time and thus have switched to paper prototyping with Figma as this is software, we are familiar with from our other courses.</p>
 
 <h3 style="color:DarkSeaGreen;">Main Limitations:</h3>
<p>Going into a little detail of the main limitations we endured for this project include some of the limitations are reiterated in the scope and limits section to emphasise the margins of the project: </p>
<p>-Time frame: It was impractical to complete the whole game in a couple of weeks’ time taking in the fact we had other commitments. In order for us to have finished the entire game it would have taken us more than a month where we would have to break down the game into small milestones and complete them in a chronological order to minimise any errors and problems.</p>
<p>- Lack of experience in software: It was evident not many of us had the skills to deliver a game product. Although we did plan to initially learn through generic tutorials and modules, as first year students in IT it was unreasonable for us to learn and code which would again correspond to the time frame given and we would not be able to produce a product for submission. We also did not think about who we would approach to troubleshoot our coding problems which would lead to unnecessary distress within team members.</p>
<p>-Limited resources: As a team of four, we would have struggled to produce the finished product. We would need more team members to work on different parts of the game which would lead to better troubleshooting and a greater influx of ideas to help us achieve certain aspects in an easier or faster way. </p>
<p>-User testing: As we do not have an interactive finished product, we cannot user test our game, this limits us to understand the needs of the user which can create loopholes in the game. </p>

<button class="accordion">BEGINNINGS: The Concept Art</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>On our first goal, it was the job of one of our team members to create the concept art for the game. She proposed to use Krita, a free drawing program, to draw before beginning on the skeleton of the game. To create the prototype, we decided to only create the necessary assets first. What we needed is a main character, an enemy to go against, and how the stage would look like.</p>
   <p>Before she started drawing however, she requested to have a story to base the concept art on. The basic premise we settled for the protagonist was this:</p>
    <p><i>Our protagonist, a well-known slacker in the devil’s realm, is a devil employed as a ‘soul prosecutor’ by Satan, a job where he was supposed to sentence sinful souls that had refused to leave earth to hell. Tired of his laziness, Satan took away his powers and sent him to a haunted motel filled with violent wandering souls -- violent enough to kill him within a few punches.</i></p>

<body>
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="200" height="150">
</body>
</html>
     <p>In the beginning, she gave him a formal suit, taking reference from modern lawyers and prosecutors. After thinking a little further, she thought it’ll be a better idea to make the protagonist look more of a slacker, or what she would describe as “a ‘Chad-looking’ jerk that does not care for feelings.” They thought the character would be better balanced if this character had a high ego.</p>
      <p>She then designed the first enemy, or the first vicious ghost on floor 01, a ghost girl with snake features on her. She made up a simple backstory for her, where this girl was involved in multiple affairs, and ends up killing every girl who confronted her about being a snake. Hence the snake features.</p>
          <html>
<body>
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="200" height="150">
</body>
</html>
       <p>Next, she created the map for this character, as well as how she thinks the interface should look and be done. On the top left is the room where the player will confront her. </p>
                 <html>
<body>
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="200" height="150">
</body>
</html>
        <p>The rooms are themed, they are based on their ghost residents. The green and blue hue was meant to give it a little bit of a rain forest feel, where snakes are often found. She also planned on putting vines all over the room. On the side, she doodled a holiday picture of two people, one with a snake head, representing the ghost girl’s true form.  

The bottom left is merely a doodle for another floor ghost she had thought about. 

With these done, we now understand the game atmosphere and design. We could now began prototyping for the game.  </p>
