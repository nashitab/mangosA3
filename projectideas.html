							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>The Motel is a puzzle based pixelated 2D side scrolling horror game where the players are required to find hints and keys in order to escape from a haunted motel filled with ghastly ‘guests’ which roam within it. Each ‘guest’ has their own unique ability, and players will have to find ways to escape from them while attempting to solve puzzles.</p>
							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>The Motel – is an idea formulated by a fellow group member, where she had suggested that we should create a horror game. A horror game to us is a fun and quirky idea because of how spooky it is. Having liked the idea and the aspect of designing a game, we were all on board for the project. As we all took a programming course and only know the python language, we wanted to take up the challenge of coding on python by using a foreign program (pygame) to create the game.  Furthermore, some of us have used python to create a game and or coded a simple project with it. An addition to why we have chosen to do a game is that it is also easy to delegate between the four of us and we can split up some of the coding to complete the game. </p>
							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>The Motel within the gaming industry would not be considered a niche game, as many has done similar games like it. The market for The Motel depends on how well the game conveys its story, since these kinds of game usually depend on its narratives more than its gameplay. The Little Nightmares series is an example of it. The general story we have is that a couple, who was in a car in the middle of nowhere after getting lost, arrived at a mysterious motel which had appeared within the darkness of the night. They went in, only to find no one in the reception. With their car tire punctured mysteriously when they return to it, they had no choice but to stay and find materials to fix the car in the meantime from the motel. That is when the player is caught and thrown into the first floor, forced to find their way back to reunite with their partner.</p>
							<h2>Tools + Tech </h2>
							<p>The puzzles on each floor will be different, ranging from math questions to abstract puzzles. While they interact with items and walk-through floors, the enemy, or the ‘guest’, will be roaming around as well, chasing the player the moment they see them. Players will be given a game over if they are caught. To avoid this, players can either hide behind structures within the floor, distract the guests, or find ways to temporarily ward them off. The temporary goal of the game is to unlock floors. Ultimately, the player is attempting to escape from the motel.</p>
							<p>The enemies we’ve came up with ranges from many different types, most inspired by other horror games of similar kind. We have a guest that only appear within fake paintings, which players would have to detect themselves. The level requires the players to find a way to ward off the guest, and destroy the fake paintings the guest was in. There is also a guest with their body parts separated into five (head and limbs), all within different rooms of the floor. The player is required to find their parts and figure out what part needs to be destroyed through finding hints of the guest’s past, while avoiding the main part, the head, from killing them.</p>
						
							<h2>Skills, outcome items</h2>
							<p>The Motel will be made using pygame, a program designed to code and create games. The program is known for making 2D based game, and it only requires users to know python, making it a friendly program for beginner coders that wants merely learn about programming rules and practices. What we expect to obtain from making this game is the understanding of python and programming rules. By understanding these, we will be able to understand other languages not limited to python easier, thus, is beneficial to us since python is not in high demand within the market as shown by the burning glass data. Furthermore, It also helps with improving our problem-solving skills, an essential skill for programming anything in general.</p>
