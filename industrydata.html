							<b>Senior software Engineer - Java</b>
							<p><b><u>career plans</u></b></p>
							<br><p>My career relies heavily on software and coding aspects which draws similarity to other engineering roles. All our jobs require basic programming techniques and refinement which is essential in the engineering job force. What differentiates some of our jobs are the actual engineering disciplines we want to focus in, such as cloud engineering vs software engineering. Our career plans are overall similar as we have to graduate in a course in the IT field and to specialize in a specific field, we may have to do a Master’s.  </p>

							<h3 style="color:Maroon">Sarah Khan</h3>
							<p><b>AWS Cloud Engineer </b></p>
							<p><b><u>career plans</u></b></p>
							<br><p>In terms of career plans my career is more cloud and customer focused as opposed to a programming focused role. However, all of our jobs do require a strong background in computers and information technology which can include trends in the market. Some are focused on the same field while others have very different options  </p>

							<h3 style="color:Maroon;">Trang Chau </h3>
							<p><b>IT support officer</b></p>
							<p><b><u>career plans</u></b></p>
							<br><p>My career is customer focused and requires good communication skills. Also requires strong knowledge of computer software or hardware. An in-depth knowledge of programs and applications such as Microsoft, Linux and Cisco are needed. All of jobs need bachelors of IT or computer sciences. My career is different from the other jobs as it does not need experience in programming.

							<h3 style="color:Maroon;">Lam Zhi Wei </h3>
							<p><b>Junior Software Engineer  </b></p>
							<p><b><u>career plans</u></b></p>
							<br><p>My career plans are like most other positions in that they’re related to developing and engineering a software. All jobs require some form of knowledge with computers, most needed some experience with programming. The only difference would be between an IT support officer, that may or may not require programming skills.  </p>
