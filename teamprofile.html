Further, our group was able to work efficiently to produce a finished report for Assignment 2, where we were able to use our individual strengths to finish it on time. New changes to improve our work ethic could include having more group meetings if time permits and following a better structure when recording the meetings to make the purpose of the meetings clear and concise. Further I am looking forward to completing this assignment and look forward to publishing a finished project.</p>
